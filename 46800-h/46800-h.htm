<p class="drop-cap">THE origin of the mediæval romance of
the Cross is hard to discover. It was
very popular. It occurs in a good number
of authors, and is depicted in a
good many churches in stained glass.</p>

<p>I may perhaps be allowed here to repeat what I
have said in my article on the Legend of the Cross,
in “Myths of the Middle Ages:”—</p>

<p>“In the churches of the city of Troyes alone it
appears in the windows of four: S. Martin-ès-Vignes,
S. Pantaléon, S. Madeleine, and S. Nizier. It is
frescoed along the walls of the choir of S. Croce at
Florence, by the hand of Agnolo Gaddi. Pietro
della Francesca also dedicated his pencil to the history
of the Cross in a series of frescoes in the chapel of
the Bacci, in the church of S. Francesco at Arezzo.
It occurs as a predella painting among the specimens<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii" id="Page_ii">[ii]</a></span>
of early art at the Accademia delle Belle Arti at
Venice, and is the subject of a picture by Beham, in
the Munich Gallery. The Legend is told in full in
the ‘Vita Christi,’ printed at Troyes in 1517; in the
‘Legenda Aurea’ of Jacques de Voragine; in a French
MS. of the thirteenth century, in the British Museum.
Gervase of Tilbury relates a portion of it in his ‘Otia
Imperalia,’ quoting Peter Comestor; it appears in the
‘Speculum Historiale’ of Gottfried of Viterbo, in the
‘Chronicon Engelhusii,’ and elsewhere.”</p>

<p>In the very curious Creation window of S. Neot’s
Church, Cornwall, Seth is represented putting three
pips of the Tree of Life into the mouth and nostrils
of dead Adam, as he buries him.</p>

<p>Of the popularity of the story of the Cross there
can be no doubt, but its origin is involved in obscurity.
It is generally possible to track most of the religious
and popular folk tales and romances of the Middle
Ages to their origin, which is frequently Oriental, but
it is not easy to do so with the Legend of the Cross.
It would rather seem that it was made up by some
romancer out of all kinds of pre-existing material, with
no other object than to write a religious novel for pious
readers, to displace the sensuous novels which were
much in vogue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii" id="Page_iii">[iii]</a></span></p>

<p>We know that this was largely done after the third
century, and a number of martyr legends, such
as those of S. Apollinaris Syncletica, SS. Cyprian and
Justina, the story of Duke Procopius, S. Euphrosyne,
SS. Zosimus and Mary, SS. Theophanes and Pansemne,
and many others were composed with this object. The
earliest of all is undoubtedly the Clementine Recognitions,
which dates from a remotely early period,
and carries us into the heart of Petrine Christianity,
and in which many a covert attack is made on S. Paul
and his teaching. On the other hand, we know that
an Asiatic priest, as Tertullian tells us, wrote a romance
on “Paul and Thecla, out of love to Paul.” S. Jerome
says that a Pauline zealot, when convicted before his
bishop of having written the romance, tried to exculpate
himself by saying that he had done it out of
admiration for S. Paul, but the Bishop would not
accept the excuse, and deprived him. Unfortunately
this romance has not come down to us, though we
have another on S. Paul and his relations to Thecla,
who is said to have accompanied him on his apostolic
rambles, disguised in male attire.</p>

<p>The Greek romance literature was not wholesome
reading for Christians. Some of the writers of these
tales became Christian bishops, and probably devoted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[iv]</a></span>
their facile pens to more edifying subjects than the
difficulties of parted lovers.</p>

<p>Heliodorus, who wrote “Theagenes and
Charicheia,” is said to have become Bishop of
Tricca, in Thessaly. Socrates, in the fifth century, in
speaking of clerical celibacy, mentions the severity of
the rule imposed on his clergy by this Heliodorus,
“under whose name there are love-books extant,
called Ethiopica, which he composed in his youth.”</p>

<p>Achilles Tatius, author of the “Loves of Clitophon
and Leucippe,” is said also to have become a bishop.
So also Eustathius of Thessalonica, author of the
“Lives of Hysemene and Hysmenias,” but this
is more than doubtful.</p>

<p>Three things conduced to the production of a
Christian romance literature in the early ages of the
Church:—(1) The necessity under which the Church
lay of supplying a want in human nature; (2) The
need there was for producing some light wholesome
literature to supply the place of the popular love-romances
then largely read and circulated; (3) The
fact that some bishops and converts were experienced
novel writers, and therefore ready to lend their hands
to some better purpose than amusing the leisure and
flattering the passions of the idle and young.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[v]</a></span></p>

<p>Much the same conditions existed in the Middle Ages.
There was an influx of sensuous literature from the
East, through the Arabs of Spain and Sicily; Oriental
tales easily took Western garb, in which the caliphs
became kings of Christendom, and the fakirs and
imauns were converted into monks and Catholic
priests. To counteract these stories, collections of
which may be found in Le Grand d’Aussi and Von
der Hagen, and in Boccaccio, the Gesta Romanorum
was drawn up, a collection of moral tales, many of
them of similar Oriental parentage. But beside these
short stories, or novels, were long romances, some
heroic, and founded on early national traditions and
ballads. To these belong the Niebelungen Lied and
Noth, the Gudrun, the Heldenbuch, the cycles of
Karlovingian and of Arthurian romance.</p>

<p>As it happens, we have two authors in the Middle
Ages, living much about the same time, one intensely
heathen in all his conceptions, the other as entirely
Christian, each dealing with subjects from the same
cycle, and the one writing in avowed opposition
to the tendency of the other’s book. I allude to
Wolfram of Eschenbach and Gottfried of Strassburg.
The latter wrote the Tristram, the former the Parzival.
In Gottfried, the moral sense seems to be absolutely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
dead; there is no perception of the sacredness of truth,
of chastity, of honour, none of religion. Wolfram is
his exact converse. Wolfram gives us the history of
the Grail, but he did not invent the myth of the
Grail, he derived it from pre-existing material.
The Grail myth is almost certainly heathen in its
origin, but it has been entirely Christianised. The
holy basin is that in which the Blood of Christ is
preserved, and only the pure of heart can see it; but
the Grail was really the great cauldron of Nature, the
basin of Ceridwen, the earth goddess of the Kelts, or,
among Teutonic nations, the sacrificial cauldron of
Odin, in which was brewed the spirit of poesy, of
the blood of Mimer. The remembrance of the
mysterious vessel remained after Kelt and Teuton
had become Christian, and the poets and romancists
gave it a new spell of life by christening it. It was
much the same with the story of the Cross. In the
Teutonic North, tree worship was widely spread; the
tree was sacred to Odin, who himself, according to
the mysterious Havamal, hung nine nights wounded,
as a sacrifice to himself, a voluntary sacrifice, in “the
wind-rocked tree.”</p>

<p>That tree was Yggdrasill, the world tree, whose roots
extended to hell, and whose branches spread to heaven.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span></p>

<p>Northern mythology is full of allusion to this
tree, but we have, unfortunately, little of the history
of it preserved to us; we know of it only through
allusions. The Christmas tree is its representative; it
has been taken up out of paganism, and rooted in
Christian soil, where it flourishes to the annual delight
of thousands of children.</p>

<p>Now the mediæval romancists laid hold of this tree,
as they laid hold of the Grail basin, and used it for
Christian purposes. The Grail cup became the chalice
of the Blood of Christ, and the Tree of Odin became
the Cross of Calvary. They worked into the romance
all kinds of material gathered from floating folk-tale
of heathen ancestry, and they pieced in with it every
scrap of allusion to a tree they could find in Scripture.
It is built up of fragments taken from all kinds of
old structures, put together with some skill, and built
into a goodly romance; but the tracing of every
stone to its original quarry has not been done by
anyone as yet. The Grail myth has had many
students and interpreters, but not the Cross myth.
That remains to be examined, and it will doubtless
prove a study rewarding the labour of investigation.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><sup>2</sup><i>Hadrian is
said to have
done this.</i></div>



<p class="drop-cap">THE Cross on which our
Lord and Saviour suffered,
would, naturally, if
properly authenticated,
be an object of the
deepest veneration to all
Christian men, be their creed, or shade of
opinion what it might; but, for over 300
years it could not be found, and it was
reserved for the Empress Helena in her
old age (for she was 79 years old) to
discover its place of concealment.<sup>1</sup> That
this <i>Invention</i>, or finding of the Cross was
believed in, at the time, there can be no
manner of doubt, for it is alluded to by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
St. Cyril, Patriarch of Jerusalem (<span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 350
to 386), and by St. Ambrose. Rufinus
of Aquila, a friend of St. Jerome, in his
<i>Ecclesiastical History</i>, gives an account
of its finding, in the following words:
“About the same time, Helena, the
mother of Constantine, a woman of
incomparable faith, whose sincere piety
was equalled by her rare munificence,
warned by celestial visions, went to Jerusalem,
and inquired of the inhabitants
where was the place where the Divine
Body had been affixed and hung on a
gibbet. This place was difficult to find,
for the persecutors of old had raised a
statue to Venus,<sup>2</sup> in order that the Christians
who might wish to adore Christ in
that place, should appear to address their
homage to the goddess; and thus it was
little frequented, and almost forgotten.
After clearing away the profane objects
which defiled it, and the rubbish that
was there heaped up, she found three
crosses placed in confusion. But the joy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
which this discovery caused her was
tempered by the impossibility of distinguishing
to whom each of them had
belonged. There, also, was found the
title written by Pilate in Greek, Latin,
and Hebrew characters; but still there
was nothing to indicate sufficiently clearly
the Cross of our Lord. This uncertainty
of man was settled by the testimony of
heaven.” And then follows the story of
the dead woman being raised to life.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Other
Authorities.</i></div>

<p>Not only did Rufinus write thus, but
Socrates, Theodoret, and Sozomen, all
of whom lived within a century after
the <i>Invention</i>, tell the same story,
so that it must have been of current
belief.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Punishment
of the Cross.</i></div>

<p>The punishment of the Cross was
a very ordinary one, and of far wider
extent than many are aware. It was
common among the Scythians, the Greeks,
the Carthaginians, the Germans, and the
Romans, who, however, principally applied
it to their slaves, and rarely crucified<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
free men, unless they were robbers or
assassins.</p>

<p>Alexander the Great, after taking the
city of Tyre, caused two thousand inhabitants
to be crucified.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Punishment
of the Cross.</i></div>

<p>Flavius Josephus relates, in his <i>Antiquities
of the Jews</i>, that Alexander, the
King of the Jews, on the capture of the
town of Betoma, ordered eight hundred
of the inhabitants to suffer the death of
the Cross, and their wives and children
to be massacred before their eyes, whilst
they were still alive.</p>

<p>Augustus, after the Sicilian War, crucified
six thousand slaves who had not
been claimed by their masters.</p>

<p>Tiberius crucified the priests of Isis,
and destroyed their temple.</p>

<p>Titus, during the siege of Jerusalem,
crucified all those unfortunates who,
to the number of five or six hundred
daily, fled from the city to escape the
famine; and so numerous were these
executions, that crosses were wanting,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span>
and the land all about seemed like a
hideous forest.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The different
sorts of Crosses.</i></div>

<p>These instances are sufficient to show
that death by crucifixion was a common
punishment; but, singularly enough, the
shape of the Cross has never been satisfactorily
settled; practically, the question
lies between the <i>Crux capitata</i>, or <i>immissa</i>,
which is the ordinary form of the Latin
Cross, and the <i>Crux ansata</i>, or <i>commissa</i>,
frequently called the <i>Tau</i> Cross, from the
Greek letter T. The <i>Tau</i>-shaped Cross
is, undoubtedly, to be met with most
frequently in the older representations;
and the more ancient authorities, such
as Tertullian, St. Jerome, St. Paulinus,
Sozomen, and Rufinus, are of opinion
that this was the shape of the Cross.
After the fifteenth century, our Lord is
rarely depicted on the <i>Crux commissa</i>, it
being reserved for the two thieves.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Antiquity of
the Tau Cross.</i></div>

<p>M. Adolphe Napoleon Didron, in
his <i>Iconographie Chretienne</i>, gives a few
illustrations of the antiquity of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span>
<i>Tau</i> Cross: “The Cross is our crucified
Lord in person; ‘Where the Cross is,
there is the martyr,’ says St. Paulinus.
Consequently it works miracles, as does
Jesus Himself: and the list of wonders
operated by its power is in truth immense.
By the simple sign of the Cross traced
upon the forehead or the breast, men
have been delivered from the most imminent
danger. It has constantly put
demons to flight, protected the virginity
of women, and the faith of believers;
it has restored men to life, or health,
inspired them with hope or resignation.</p>

<p>“Such is the virtue of the Cross, that
a mere allusion to that sacred sign, made
even in the Old Testament, and long
before the existence of the Cross, saved
the youthful Isaac from death, redeemed
from destruction an entire people whose
houses were marked by that symbol,
healed the envenomed bites of those who
looked at the serpent raised in the form
of a <i>Tau</i> upon a pole. It called back the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[xv]</a></span>
soul into the dead body of the son of that
poor widow who had given bread to the
prophet.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Tau Cross.</i></div>

<p>“A beautiful painted window, belonging
to the thirteenth century, in the
Cathedral of Bourges, has a representation
of Isaac bearing on his shoulders
the wood that was to be used in
his sacrifice, arranged in the form of a
Cross; the Hebrews, too, marked the
lintel of their dwellings with the blood
of the Paschal lamb, in the form of a
<i>Tau</i> or Cross without a summit. The
widow of Sarepta picked up and held
crosswise two pieces of wood, with which
she intended to bake her bread. These
figures, to which others also may be
added, serve to exalt the triumph of the
Cross, and seem to flow from a grand
central picture which forms their source,
and exhibits Jesus expiring on the Cross.
It is from that real Cross indeed, bearing
the Saviour, that these subjects from the
Old Testament derive all their virtue.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Wood of the
Cross.</i></div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Cross made
of pine.</i></div>

<p>The wood of which it was made is as
unsettled as its shape. The Venerable
Bede says that our Lord’s Cross was made
of four kinds of wood: the inscription
of box, the upright beam of cypress, the
transverse of cedar, and the lower part of
pine. John Cantacuméne avers that only
three woods were employed: the upright,
cedar; the transverse, pine; and the head
in cypress. Others say that the upright
was cypress, the transverse in palm, and
the head in olive; or cedar, cypress, and
olive. Most authorities seem to concur
that it was made of several woods, but
there is a legend that it was made from
the aspen tree, whose leaves still tremble
at the awful use the tree was put to;
whilst that veritable traveller, Sir John
Maundeville, says: “And also in Iherusalem
toward the Weast is a fayre church
where the tree grew of the which the
Crosse was made.” Lipsius says that it
was made of but one wood, and that
was oak; but M. Rohault de Fleury (to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[xvii]</a></span>
whose wonderful and comprehensive
work, <i>Mémoire sur les Instruments de la
Passion de notre Sauveur Jesus Christ</i>, I
am deeply indebted, says, “M. Decaisne,
member of the Institut, and M. Pietro
Savi, professor at the University of Pisa,
have shewn me by the microscope that
the pieces in the Church of the Holy
Cross of Jerusalem at Rome, in the
Cathedral at Pisa, in the Duomo at
Florence, and in Notre Dame at Paris,
were of <i>pine</i>.” And he adds, in a footnote,
“Independently of the experiments
which M. Savi kindly made in my
presence, he wrote me the results of other
observations, which tended to confirm.”</p>

<p>Starting with the Invention of the
Holy Cross, the loving, but fervid,
imaginations of the faithful soon wove
round it a covering of imagery, as we
have just seen in the case of the several
woods of the Cross, and the sacred tree
became the subject of a legend (for so it
always was only meant to be), which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[xviii]</a></span>
was incorporated in the <i>Legenda Aurea
Sanctorum</i>, or <i>Golden Legend of the Saints</i>,
of Jacobus de Voragine, a collection of
legends connected with the services of
the Church. This book was exceedingly
popular, and, when Caxton set up his
printing-press at Westminster, he produced
a translation, the history of which
he quaintly tells us in a preface.<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Caxton’s

<p>As this Golden Legend is the standard
authority on the subject, and as it will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[xix]</a></span>
much assist the intelligent appreciation
of the wood-blocks, I reproduce it,

And sayd to hym that whan that bare

his fader deed / and planted this tree
upon his grave / And it endured there
un to the tyme of Salomon / and bycause
he sawe that it was fayre, he dyd<sup>10</sup> doo
hewe it doun / and sette it in his hows

the tyme approched of the passyon of

of this pyece of tymbre made the Iewes
the crosse of our lord / Thenne after
this hystorye / the crosse by which we
been saved / came of the tree by whiche
we were dampned. And the water of
that pyscyne had not his vertue onely of
the aungel / but of the tre/. With this
tre wherof the crosse was maad / there
was a tree that went over thwarte / on
whiche the armes of our lord were
nayled/. And another pyece above which

It happed that this notarye after this on

thenne they fought longe / And at the

and subdued hym to his empyre / The
hoost that was contrary / and alle the
peple of Cosdroe obeyed them to the
Crysten faythe / and receyved the hooly
baptysme / And Cosdroe knew not the
end of the batayll / For he was adoured
and worshiped of alle the peple as a god
/ so that no man durst say nay to him /
And thenne Heracle came to hym / and
fonde hym syttinge in his syege<sup>34</sup> of
golde / and sayd to hym / For as moche
as after the manere thou hast honoured

and brought it ageyne to Ierusalem / and
as he descended from the mount of

gate by whiche our savyour wente to his
passyon on horsbacke adourned as a Kynge
/ sodenly the stones of the gates descended
/ and ioyned them togyder in
the gate like a wall &amp; all the peple was
abashed<sup>35</sup> / and thenne the Aungel of

and gaf to them grete geftes / And after
retorned home to his Empyre / And hit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlix" id="Page_xlix">[xlix]</a></span>
is said in the Cronycles that this was
done otherwise / For they say that
whanne Cosdroe hadde taken many
Royammes / he took Iherusalem / and
Zacharye the patriarke / and bare aweye
the tree of the Crosse / And as Heracle
wold make pees with hym / the Kyng
Cosdroe swore a grete othe / that he wold
never make pees with Crysten men and
Romayns / yf they denyed not hym that
was crucyfyed / and adoured the sonne /.
And thenne Heracle / whiche was armed
wythe faythe / brought his hooste ageynst
hym / and destroyed and wasted the
Persyens with many batayles that he
made to them / and made Cosdroe to
flee unto the Cyte of thelyfonte /. And
atte the laste Cosdroe hadde the flyxe in
his bely / And wolde therefore crowne
his sone Kynge / which was named
Mendasa /. And whenne Syroys his
oldest sone herde thereof he made alyance
with Heracle / And pursewed his fader
with his noble peple / and set hym in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_l" id="Page_l">[l]</a></span>
bondes / And susteyned him with breede
of trybulacion / and with water of
anguysshe / And atte last he made to
shote arowes at him bycause he wold not
bileve in god &amp; so deyde / &amp; after this
thynge he sente to Heracle the patriarke
the tree of the Crosse and all the prysoners
/ And Heracle bare into Iherusalem
the precious tree of the Crosse /.
And thus it is redde in many Cronycles
also/. Sybyle sayth thus of the tre of the
Crosse / that the blessyd tree of the
Crosse was thre tymes with the paynyms
/ as it is sayd in thystorie trypertyte O
thryse blessyd tree on whiche god was
stratched / This peradventure is sayd for
the lyf of Nature / of grace / and of
glorye / which cam of the crosse /. At
Constantynople a Iewe entyred in to the
chirche of seynt sophye / and consydered
that he was there allone / and sawe an
ymage of Ihesu cryste / and tooke his
swerde and smote thymage in the throte
/ and anone the bloode guysshed oute /<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_li" id="Page_li">[li]</a></span>
and sprange in the face and on the hide
of the Iewe / And he thenne was aferd
and took thymage / and cast it into a
pytte / and anone fledde awey /. And it
happed that a Crysten man mett hym /
and sawe hym al blody / and sayd to
hym / fro whens comest thou / thou
hast slayne soume man / And he sayd I
have not / the crysten man sayd Veryly
thou has commysed somme homycyde /
for thou art all besprongen<sup>37</sup> with the
blood. And the Jewe said / Veryly the
god of Crysten men is grete and the
faythe of hym is ferme and approved in
all thynges / I have smyten no man /
but I have smyten thymage of Ihesu
Cryste / and anone yssued blood of his
throte /. And thenne the Jewe brought
the Crysten man to the pytte / and then
they drewe oute that hooly ymage /.
And yet is sene on this daye the wounde
in the throte of thymage / And the Iewe
anone bycam a good Crysten man, &amp;
was baptysed / In Syre in the cyte of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lii" id="Page_lii">[lii]</a></span>

forgate &amp; lefte thymage behynde hym /
and it happed that a Iewe hyred that

as they were at mete it happed hym that

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Having read these extracts from the
Golden Legend, we shall be able to
understand the accompanying illustrations,
which represent some frescos of
the fifteenth century, which formerly
adorned the walls of the / Chapel of the
Gild of the Holy Cross, at Stratford-upon-Avon;
which stands close by New Place,
Shakespeare’s house. These frescos, alas!
no longer exist, for, in 1804, the Chapel
underwent considerable repair, during
which, under the whitewash, were discovered
traces of paint, and these, being
scraped, a series illustrating the legend of
the Cross was found in the chancel,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxii" id="Page_lxii">[lxii]</a></span>
which was built in 1450. In other
parts of the Chapel were found representations
of the Ressurection, and the
day of Judgment, St. George and the
Dragon, and the death of St. Thomas a
Becket, besides others.</p>

<p>Luckily, a gentleman from London, a
Mr. Fisher, was then staying at Stratford-on-Avon,
and he drew, and painted them—afterwards,
in 1807, publishing them—and
it is from his sketches that these
illustrations are taken. The barbarians
of Stratford hacked the plaster on which
the Holy Cross series was painted to bits,
and whitewashed all the other paintings.
It is presumed they still exist, for, when
the Chapel was thoroughly restored in
1835, traces of the other pictures were
visible under the whitewash.</p>

<p>These pictures of the Invention, and
Exaltation, of the Holy Cross are especially
interesting, not only on account
of their age and artistic merit, but from
the fact that they are of English work,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxiii" id="Page_lxiii">[lxiii]</a></span>
and show the English idea of treating
the subject. I have reproduced them all
but two; one, the fight on the bridge
over the Danube between Heraclius and
the son of Chosroes, and the other
representing Heraclius smiting off Chosroes’
head.</p>

<p>Plate <span class="letter">A</span> represents the visit of the
Queen of Sheba to Solomon. Her name
was Balkis, and, in her legendary history,
it is reported that Solomon, having heard
of her riches and power, sent her a
peremptory message to submit herself to
his rule. She, dreading war with so
potent a sovereign, sent an embassy to
try and find out whether Solomon was
as wise as he was represented to be.
With this object she dressed five hundred
boys as girls, and a like number of girls
as boys, and, among other presents, sent
a pearl, a diamond cut through in
zigzags, and a crystal box; and she
should be able to judge of his wisdom
and power, if he could tell the boys from
the girls, pierce the pearl, thread the
diamond, and fill the goblet with water
that came neither from the earth nor
the sky.</p>

<p>Needless to say, Solomon passed through
the ordeal triumphantly. He ordered
silver basins to be brought, so that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxvi" id="Page_lxvi">[lxvi]</a></span>
ambassadors’ suite might wash their hands
after their long journey, and the boys
were easily distinguished from the girls, for
they dipped their hands only in the water,
whilst the girls tucked up their sleeves
and washed their arms as well as their
hands. Then he opened the box containing
the pearl, diamond, and goblet,
and, taking out the pearl, he applied his
magic stone, Samur, or Schamir, which
a raven had brought him, and which
had the power of cleaving anything, and
lo! the pearl was pierced; then he
examined the diamond, which was so
pierced that no thread could be passed
through it; so he took a worm, and
having placed a piece of silk in its mouth,
it wriggled through, and the diamond
was threaded. The next task was to fill
the goblet, which he gave to a negro
slave, and bade him mount a wild horse
and gallop it till it streamed with sweat,
and then to fill the goblet with it, thus
fulfilling the imposed conditions. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxvii" id="Page_lxvii">[lxvii]</a></span>
then gave back these presents to the
ambassadors, who speedily returned to
Queen Balkis. She at once saw that it
would be useless to oppose the powerful
will of Solomon, and immediately set out
on her journey to that monarch.</p>

<p>It is here that her connection with the
holy Cross comes in, for its wood, which
Solomon had cut down in order to
incorporate it into his Temple, and
which had the inconvenient property of
fitting in nowhere, being either too long
or too short for any purpose, was in
consequence thrown aside, and ultimately
was used as a foot-bridge across a brook.
Across this plank the Queen had to pass,
but she, recognising its holy virtue,
refused to walk across it, preferring to
wade the brook, which, having done, she
expounded its value to Solomon, and
prophesied that out of it should be made
the Cross on which Jesus should suffer.</p>

<p>She afterwards became one of Solomon’s
wives, and bore him a son, and then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxviii" id="Page_lxviii">[lxviii]</a><br /><a name="Page_lxix" id="Page_lxix">[lxix]</a></span>
returned to her own land, and from this
son are descended the kings of Abyssynia.</p>

<p>The legend on the label is, as far as is
legible, <span class="smcap">Regina Saba fama Salomonis</span>
(adduct) <span class="smcap">a venit</span> (Iero)<span class="smcap">soluma ubi

<p>Plate <span class="letter">B</span> is, virtually, two; one showing
the angel appearing to Constantine when,
early in the fourth century, he was
advancing towards Rome against Maxentius;
but the legend of the miraculous
inscription which appeared in the sky,
“<span class="smcap">In hoc signo vinces</span>,” does not appear.
The other, and larger portion, represents
his victory over Maxentius, and he is
represented as spearing and killing that
monarch; but this is not historically
correct, for, after his defeat, as Maxentius
fled towards Rome, essaying to cross the
Tiber over a rotten bridge, it gave way,
and he was drowned. It is noticeable
that the Christian flag bears the Tau
Cross.</p>

the upper part St. Helena is receiving the
holy Cross, whilst labourers are uncovering
the Tau Crosses of the two thieves.</p>

<p>The legend is mutilated, but enough
remains to make its meaning clear:

<p><i>The legend in Plate</i> <span class="letter">E</span> <i>is nearly perfect,

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxi" id="Page_lxxi">[lxxi]</a></span></p>

<p>Here all the Crosses are of the Tau
type, and the scene is laid in a forest,
where an old labourer, and a bill-man,
and the deer nibbling the trees,
give a rural aspect, instead of in the
City of Jerusalem, as saith the Golden
Legend.</p>

<p>Plate <span class="letter">F</span> evidently consists of two
separate paintings—one, where St. Helena
is reverently carrying the Cross into
Jerusalem, whilst the angels in heaven are
discoursing celestial music; and the other,
its reception either in Jerusalem or
Byzantium, whither St. Helena sent a portion
as a present to her son. And this
latter seems the more probable, if we
imagine the King, who, with St. Helena,
is adoring the Crucifix, to be the emperor
Constantine, a fact which might have
been settled had the label been legible.</p>

<p>The legend at the bottom is unfortunately
mutilated, but that evidently
relates to that portion of the Cross which
remained at Jerusalem, because it speaks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxii" id="Page_lxxii">[lxxii]</a><br /><a name="Page_lxxiii" id="Page_lxxiii">[lxxiii]</a></span>

<p>Plates <span class="letter">G</span> and <span class="letter">H</span> represent the story
told in the Golden Legend, of Heraclius
bearing the Cross into Jerusalem, how
the gate miraculously closed, and an
angel appeared in the heavens and
reproved Heraclius for riding in state
on the very spot where Jesus had gone
in all meekness, and lowliness, to His
passion. The legend is erased in parts,
the unmutilated portion reading, “<span class="smcap">As

<p>Naturally, the possession of a piece of
the true Cross would be esteemed as a
most precious property. No matter how
small, it would be reverentially enclosed
in crystal and gold, and was more than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxiv" id="Page_lxxiv">[lxxiv]</a></span>
a present fit for an emperor or king, and
we cannot marvel that small pieces were
distributed all over Christendom. Possibly
some of the relics shown as pieces of the
very Cross might not have been what
they were supposed to be, but it is hard
to believe what John Calvin<a name="FNanchor_K_11" id="FNanchor_K_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_K_11" class="fnanchor">[K]</a> wrote
about it:—</p>

<p>“And fyrst of all let us begynne to
speake of his crosse, whereupon he was
hanged. I know that it is holden for a
certaintie that it was founde of Heline
the mother of Constantine the Romaine
Emperour. I knowe also what certaine
Doctours have written touching the
approbation hereof, for to certifie that
the crosse which she found was without
doute the selfe same on the whiche
Iesus Christ was hanged. Touchynge
all this I reporte me to the thynge it selfe,
so much is there that it was but a folish
curiositie of her, or at the least a folishe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxv" id="Page_lxxv">[lxxv]</a></span>
and unconsidered devotion. But yet put
the case it had ben a worke worthy of
prayse to her, for to have taken paynes
to fynde the trewe crosse, and that our
lord had then declared by myracle that
it was his crosse which she found; Yet
let us onely consider that which is of our
time. Every one doeth holde that this
crosse which Helene founde is yet at
Ierusalem, and none doeth doute thereof.
Although the Ecclesiasticall history against
sayeth the same notablye. For it is ther
recited that Helene toke one part thereof
to send to the Emperour her sonne, who
put the same at Constantinople upon a
fyne pyller of Marble in the myddest of
the market. Of the other part, it is
sayde that she did locke the same in a
copher of silver, and gave it to the Bishop
of Ierusalem to kepe. So then eyther
we shall augment the historie of a lie or
els that which is holden at this daye of
the true Crosse, is but a vayne and
triflyng opinion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxvi" id="Page_lxxvi">[lxxvi]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><sup>51</sup><i>Blocks—billets</i></div>

<p>“Let us consider on the other part
howe many peeces there are thereof
throug out the worlde. Yf I would
onely recite that whiche I coulde say
there woulde be a register sufficient to
fyl a whole boke. There is not so little
a town where there is not some peece
thereof, and that not onelye in cathedrall
churches, but also in some parishes.
Likewise ther is not so wicked an abbey
where there is not of it to be shewed.
And in some places ther are good great
shydes:<sup>51</sup> as at the holye chappell of Paris,
and at Poitiers &amp; at Rome, where there
is a great crucifix made thereof as men
saye. To be short, yf a man woulde
gather together all that hath bene founde
of this crosse, there would be inough to
fraighte a great ship. The Gospell testifieth
that the crosse myght be caried of
one man. What audacitie then was this
to fyll the earth with pieces of wod in
suche quantitie, that thre hundred men
can not cary them,” &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxvii" id="Page_lxxvii">[lxxvii]</a></span></p>

<p>Calvin was full of zeal, and could not
stoop to particularise. Witness his assertion
that the Cross would freight a ship,
and yet that three hundred men could
carry it. M. Rohault de Fleury has
gone very minutely into this matter.
Knowing, from microscopical examination,
that several of the relics of the
Cross were of pine, he accepts this wood
as his basis, and, from its probable size,
he deduces a weight of 100 kilogrammes,
equal to about 240 English lbs.; and,
taking the average density of pine, he
estimates that this would give 178 millions
of cubic millimetres. He then
describes all the known pieces in Europe,
Jerusalem, and Mount Athos, with their
measurements, and he puts the outcome
at 3,941,975 cubic millimetres; thus,
according to his shewing, there is but a
very small portion of the Holy Cross in
existence. I subjoin his list of the
places in which pieces of the Cross are
known to exist, as it is most interesting,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxviii" id="Page_lxxviii">[lxxviii]</a></span>

<p>According to this table we are credited
in England with 30,516 cubic millimetres
of the holy Cross, and it is interesting
to know where they are situated. M.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxxii" id="Page_lxxxii">[lxxxii]</a></span>

<p>One relic at St. Mary’s Convent, York,
is very fine; it is ornamented with scroll-work
of the tenth century, and bears
three impressions of the seal of the Vicar
Capitular of the diocese of Saint Omer,
1657 to 1662. It is a pectoral cross that
is supposed to have belonged to the
patriarch Arnulph, who was with Robert,
Duke of Normandy.</p>

<p>The other is supposed to have been
attached to the above, and to have
belonged equally to Arnulph, patriarch
of Jerusalem. This is kept in a silver
reliquary, which also contains relics of
SS. Ignatius Loyola and François Xavier.</p>

<p>We see by the Golden Legend, that
St. Helena, after finding the Cross, feeling
certain that the nails were not far off,
prosecuted a further search for them, and
they were discovered “shynyng as gold.”
As with the fashion of the Cross, whether
it was <i>immissa</i> or <i>commissa</i>, there is, and
was, a controversy with regard to the
nails, whether three or four.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxxiv" id="Page_lxxxiv">[lxxxiv]</a></span></p>

<p>Bosius in his learned and exhaustive
book, <i>Crux Triumphans et Gloriosa</i>,<a name="FNanchor_L_12" id="FNanchor_L_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_L_12" class="fnanchor">[L]</a> gives
several authorities for three nails only—foremost,
Gregory Nazianzen; but he
does not give the passage where it may
be found; the quotation, however, is</p>

<p class='center'>
Γυμνὸν τρισήλῳ κείμενον ξύλῳ λαϐών<br />
</p>

<p class='unindent'>“having taken from the three-nailed
wood the dead (or hanging) body.” Thus
clearly showing the number of nails he
considered right.</p>

<p>Bosius then goes on to quote Apollinaris
Laodicenus, who, in his tragedy entitled
<i>Christus patiens</i>, called the holy Cross by
the same words, τσισηλον ξυλω, “three-nailed
wood”; and he also quotes from the
<i>Meditat. vitæ Christi</i> of Bonaventura, “<i>Illi
tres clavi sustinent totius corporis pondus</i>.”
Nonnus, the Greek poet, writing in the
fifth century, also says that our Lord’s
feet overlapped each other, and were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxxv" id="Page_lxxxv">[lxxxv]</a></span>
fastened by only one large nail. So that
there is a very fair amount of antiquity
in favour of three nails.</p>

<p>Against this theory may be quoted the
authority of St. Cyprian, St. Augustine,
St. Gregory of Tours, Pope Innocent III.,
Rufinus, Theodoret, and others, who say
four nails were used in the Crucifixion of
our Saviour. The battle waged pictorially;
but perhaps the earliest known
representation of the Crucifixion, that
found in the Cemetery of St. Julian,
Pope, or of St. Valentine in Via Flaminia
at Rome, ought to bear most weight.
Our Saviour is represented as being clothed
in a long sleeveless robe, which reaches
to His ankles; the feet are separate, and
are each nailed. It is said that Cimabue
was the first to paint the feet overlapping,
and one nail. His example, however,
was much followed, and hence the
controversy.</p>

<p>Of these nails, universal tradition says
that St. Helena sent two to her son<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxxvi" id="Page_lxxxvi">[lxxxvi]</a></span>
Constantine, and, as the Golden Legend
has it, “the emperour dyd do sette them
in hys brydel and in hys helme when he
wente to batayle.” One can understand
one of these sacred nails being worn in
the Emperour’s helmet as a presage
of victory and as a safeguard against
danger, but the utility of incorporating
one of such priceless relics in a horse’s
bridle is not so easy to comprehend; but
the fathers of the Church, St. Cyril of
Alexandria, St. Ambrose, Theodoret, and
St. Gregory of Tours, recognise in it the
fulfilment of the prophecy of Zecharius,
chap. xiv. 20: “In that day shall be
upon the bridles of the horses, <span class="smcap">Holiness
unto the Lord</span>.”</p>

<p>This bridle, or rather bit, is now said
to be in existence in France at Carpentras,
department of Vaucluse. How it got
there is not clearly known, but probably
it was taken at the time of the Crusades—as
leaden seals on which it is engraved
exist, attached to parchments of the dates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxxvii" id="Page_lxxxvii">[lxxxvii]</a></span>
1226 and 1250, and it was mentioned in
an inventory of relics in the year 1322.</p>

<p>I have reproduced it, as well as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxxviii" id="Page_lxxxviii">[lxxxviii]</a></span>
Iron Crown of Lombardy and the nails,
from M. Rohault de Fleury’s work, and,
as will be seen, it is undoubtedly of
great antiquity, closely resembling the
bits of the Romans.</p>

<p>According to Bosius, who quotes
Gregory Nazianzen, a third nail was
thrown by St. Helena into the Adriatic
Sea, in order to calm a tempest; and the
same authority says that the fourth was
deposited in the head of a statue of Constantine,
but this militates much against
the number of holy nails said to be in
existence. Calvin notices this, and is
down upon it with sledge-hammer
force:—</p>

<p>“Yet there is a greater combat of the
nayles. I wyll recite them only that are
come to my knowledge. Thereupon
there is not so lytle a childe but wyll
judge that the Devyll hath to much deluded
the worlde in takyng from it both
understandyng and reason, that it coulde
discerne nothynge in this matter. If the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxxix" id="Page_lxxxix">[lxxxix]</a></span>
auncient writers saye trewe, and namely
Theodorite Historiographer of the auncient
churche, Helene caused one to be
nayled on her sonne’s helmet, the other
two she put in his horse bitte. How be
it Sainct Ambrose sayeth not fully so.
For he sayeth that one was put in
Constantine’s crowne, of the other his
horsebit was made, and the thirde Helene
kept. Wee se y<sup>t</sup> already more than
twelve hundred yeres agone this hath
bene in controversie, to wit, what was
become of the nayles. What certentie
can be had of them then at this present
time?</p>

<p>“Now at Millan they boste that thei
have y nayle that was put in Constantine’s
horse bitte. To the whiche the towne
of Carpentras opposeth herselfe, sayinge
that it is she that hath it. Nowe S.
Ambrose doth not saye that the nayle
was knit to the bitte, but that the bitte
was made thereof. Whiche thynge can
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xc" id="Page_xc">[xc]</a></span>in no wyse be made to agre eyther w<sup>t</sup>
their saying of Milan or w<sup>t</sup> theirs of
Carpentras.</p>

<p>“Moreover there is one in Rome at
Sainct Helenes; another also at Sene,
another at Venise. In Germany two:
at Collyne one, at the three Maries:
another at Triers, one in Fraunce at the
holy chappell of Paris, another at y<sup>e</sup>
Carmes, one also at Sainct Denis in
France: one at Burges: one at Tenaill,
one at Draguine.</p>

<p>“Beholde here fourteene, whereof
account is made; in every place they
alledge good approbation for themselves,
as they suppose. And so it is that everye
one hath as good right as aunother.
Wherefor there is no better way then to
make them all passe under one fidelium.
That is to saye, to repute all that they
saye hereof to be but lyes, seying that
otherwise a man shoulde never come to
an ende.”</p>

<p>What would Calvin have said if he
had seen the formidable list of holy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xci" id="Page_xci">[xci]</a></span>
nails enumerated by Guisto (or Justus)
Fontanini, Archbishop of Ancyra? which
is as follows:—</p>


<ul><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Aix la Chapelle.</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Ancona, in the Cathedral.</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Bamberg.</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;4. In Bavaria, Convent of Audechsen.</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;5. Carpentras. The Holy Bit.</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;6. Catania, Sicily.</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;7. Colle, in Tuscany.</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;8. Cologne.</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;9. The Escurial in Spain.</li>
<li>10. Milan.</li>
<li>11. Monza. The Iron Crown.</li>
<li>12. Naples. Monastery of S. Patricius.</li>
<li>13. Nuremberg. Church of the Holy Virgin.</li>
<li>14. Paris.</li>
<li><div class='hang1'>15. Rome. Two Nails. Church of the Holy Cross of Jerusalem; Church of Santa Maria in Campitelli.</div></li>
<li><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xcii" id="Page_xcii">[xcii]</a></span>16. Sienna. Hospital Sainte Marie de de l’Echelle.</li>
<li>17. Spoleto.</li>
<li>18. Torcello, near Venice. Church of S. Anthony.</li>
<li>19. Torno, on the Lake of Como.</li>
<li>20. Toul.</li>
<li>21. Trèves.</li>
<li>22. Venice. Three nails.</li>
<li>23. Vienna.</li></ul>



<p>But this list is further supplemented
by M. Rohault de Fleury, who gives
six more:—</p>


<ul><li>1. Arras, according to M. le Chev. de Linas.</li>
<li>2. Compiègne. A point.</li>
<li>3. Cracow, in Poland, according to M. Gosselin.</li>
<li>4. Florence.</li>
<li>5. Lagney.</li>
<li>6. Troyes.</li></ul>



<p class='unindent'>So that no less than twenty-nine towns
claim the possession of thirty-two nails, all
differing in form, the number of which
can only be accounted for by the supposition
that only a portion of the holy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xciii" id="Page_xciii">[xciii]</a></span>
nails has been incorporated into each of
them.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

<div class="caption"><i>The Title of the Cross.</i></div>
</div>

<p>One of the most interesting relics in
connection with the holy nails is the
Iron Crown of Lombardy. This, as may
be seen by reference to the illustration
(Fig. 1), is a circlet of gold, ornamented
with precious stones, and it is indebted
for its name of “Iron” to a thin band (<span class="letter">A</span>)
of that metal, which is inside the gold
circlet. The Crown itself is of very
antique form, being even devoid of rays,
and is too small to go on the head.
Charlemagne was crowned with it in
774, and Napoleon did not think himself
King of Italy until he had placed
this precious diadem on his head, in
1805. It is kept at Monza, nine miles
from Milan, in the Cathedral, which is
of great antiquity. There it reposes in
a huge cross placed over the altar.</p>

<p>Of the relics of the Cross there now
remains but two specks of the title or
inscription thereon, and here, again, I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xciv" id="Page_xciv">[xciv]</a><br /><a name="Page_xcv" id="Page_xcv">[xcv]</a></span>
indebted to M. Rohault de Fleury for
the illustration on page xciv., as it seems
to me to be the best yet published.</p>

<p>The Evangelists, although agreeing in
the spirit of the inscription, vary as to the
letter.</p>



<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="Inscriptions by Gospel">
<tr><td align="left">Says&nbsp;</td><td align="left">St. Matthew: “This is Jesus the King of the Jews.”</td></tr>

<tr><td align="center">“</td><td align="left">St. John: ”Jesus of Nazareth the King of the Jews.“</td></tr>
</table></div>


<p>Neither St. Matthew nor St. Mark note
the tri-lingual character, and SS. Luke
and John vary as to the order of the
different languages; the former saying
it was in Greek, Latin, and Hebrew—the
latter that it was in Hebrew, Greek,
and Latin. The latter is the generally
accepted form, and the reason given is,
that Hebrew, being the common
language, it would naturally come first,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xcvi" id="Page_xcvi">[xcvi]</a></span>
as we should do in an English notice, first
in English, then, say in French and
German, for the benefit of foreigners,
as were the Greeks and Romans in
Jerusalem.</p>

<p>The tradition is that, along with the
Cross, St. Helena found the inscription,
and that she sent it, together with a piece
of the Holy Cross and a number of other
sacred relics, to Rome, where it was
deposited in the basilica of Santa Croce.
Here it remained until Valentinian,
fearing that it might fall into the hands
of the Goths and Huns, hid it in the
wall of the building, until it was found
in 1492.</p>

<p>Valentinian died <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 375, and Antoninus
Martyr, in his <i>De Locis Sanctis</i> (sec. 20),
written about <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 570, says he saw the
inscription which had been placed on the
Cross, and that the words were, “Iesus
Nazarenus Rex Iudæorum.” He says that
he held it in his hand, and kissed it, in
the Church of Constantine at <i>Jerusalem</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xcvii" id="Page_xcvii">[xcvii]</a></span>
Hence it is evident that either tradition is
incorrect, or that Antoninus did not tell
the truth.</p>

<p>But the claim is that it is, and always
has been, in Rome, and Bosius, in his
<i>Crux Triumphans</i> (p. 60), gives an account
of its re-discovery. He says that in
February, 1492, Monseigneur Pedro
Gonsalvo de Mendoza, Cardinal Sanctæ
Crucis, was repairing and cleansing his
church, and on the first day of that month,
when the workmen reached the top of
the arch which was in the middle of the
basilica, and near the roof, they saw two
small columns; and finding a space, they
discovered a niche in which they found a
leaden box, well closed, and on its lid
was a tablet of marble, on which were
engraved these words: <span class="smcap">Hic est Titvlvs
Veræ Crucis</span>. In this box was found
a little board, about a hand’s breadth
and a half, much corroded on one side
by time, and bearing, in grooved, engraved
characters, which were coloured red, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xcviii" id="Page_xcviii">[xcviii]</a></span>
following inscription: <span class="smcap">Iesvs Nazarenvs
Rex Ivdæorvm</span>. But the word <span class="smcap">Ivdæorvm</span>
was not entire, the last two letters <span class="smcap">vm</span>
having crumbled to pieces by reason of
old age. The first line was written in
Latin characters, the second in Greek,
and the third in Hebrew.</p>

<p>All the city went to see it; and three
days afterwards, Pope Innocent went also,
and ordered the relic to be preserved in
its box, and covered with a sheet of
glass. Every one was convinced that
they had before their eyes the inscription
which Pilate placed upon the Cross over
our Saviour’s head, and which Saint
Helena had deposited in the church at
the time of its building.</p>

<p>The relic, as now seen, is very worm-eaten,
but the letters are still visible,
and have been cut with a small gouge.
They read from right to left, as Hebrew
does, thus lending great plausibility to
the idea that it was done by some Jewish
artificers; and it seems to be of some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xcix" id="Page_xcix">[xcix]</a></span>
close-grained wood. Taking the piece
now at Santa Croce, the whole inscription,
if restored, would be thus:</p>

<p class="drop-cap">THE History of the Legend
of the Holy Cross which
is here reproduced, is
somewhat fuller than the
Golden Legend of Caxton,
there being particulars
about Moses, David, and Solomon not
to be found therein; but they may be
found in other versions of the Legend, some
in the Latin of Jacobus de Voragine, others
in two MSS. in the British Museum.<a name="FNanchor_M_13" id="FNanchor_M_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_M_13" class="fnanchor">[M]</a></p>

<p>The engravings are taken from a very
rare book, of which, as far as is known,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_cii" id="Page_cii">[cii]</a></span>
there are but three copies in existence:
one is in the Royal Library at Brussels,
another at the Hague, in the collection
of Mr. Schinkel, and the third is in the
possession of Lord Spencer at Althorp.
It is from this book that these fac-similes
(made by M. J. Ph. Berjeau) were taken.
The book itself has one woodcut on each
page, with a verse in Dutch, at the
bottom, explanatory of each engraving.
It is called indifferently <i>Historia Sanctæ
Crucis</i> or <i>Boec van den houte</i> (Book of
the wood or tree).</p>

<p>It was printed at Kuilenburg on March
6th, 1483, by John Veldener,<a name="FNanchor_N_14" id="FNanchor_N_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_N_14" class="fnanchor">[N]</a> who had
just removed from Louvain. These
sixty-four engravings were originally on
thirty-two blocks,<a name="FNanchor_O_15" id="FNanchor_O_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_O_15" class="fnanchor">[O]</a> and evidently belonged
to some much older block book, now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ciii" id="Page_ciii">[ciii]</a></span>
lost. These, Veldener cut in half, as he
had already treated a <i>Speculum</i>, and
brought them out as a fresh book.</p>

<p>The Legend as told by these engravings
is as follows:—</p>

<p>Adam, feeling himself about to die,
sent Seth to Paradise to beg for some of
the oil of mercy,<sup><a id="note_1"></a>1</sup> which, however, the
Archangel Michael refused to give him,
but, instead, presented him with three
seeds of the tree of life.<sup><a id="note_2"></a>2</sup> On his return,
he found Adam dead, and, being unable
to administer these seeds to his father in
any other manner, he put them under
his tongue, and then buried him.<sup><a id="note_3"></a>3</sup> Presently
these seeds germinated and shot
through the ground, and are traditionally
said to have been a cedar, a cypress, and
a pine.<sup><a id="note_4"></a>4</sup> They grew until Moses had led
the Israelites out of Egypt, when he found
them in the Valley of Hebron, and he
recognized them as typifying the Trinity.
He removed them, and they were his
constant companions.<sup><a id="note_5"></a>5</sup> With them he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_civ" id="Page_civ">[civ]</a></span>
smote the rock, and the waters gushed
out,<sup><a id="note_6"></a>6</sup> and the bitter waters of Marah

<p>He then planted them in the land of
Moab,<sup><a id="note_9"></a>9</sup> and there they remained, until an
angelic vision appeared unto David, and
commanded him to go, and take them
up, and bring them to Jerusalem.<sup><a id="note_10"></a>10</sup> On
his return the three rods worked miracles,
healing the sick,<sup><a id="note_11"></a>11</sup> and the leprous, with
a touch;<sup><a id="note_12"></a>12</sup> nay, more, on being applied to

<p>Arrived at Jerusalem, they wished to
plant them, but for the night they left
them in a cistern, by the Tower of
David,<sup><a id="note_14"></a>14</sup> and lo! during the night, they
struck root, and, entwining themselves,
became but one stem,<sup><a id="note_15"></a>15</sup> which, when
David saw, he had a wall built round it.<sup><a id="note_16"></a>16</sup>
And the tree grew for thirty years, David
ornamenting it with rings of sapphire
and other precious stones, adding one for
every year, and under this tree he composed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_cv" id="Page_cv">[cv]</a></span>
the Psalms, and praised God
exceedingly.<sup><a id="note_17"></a>17</sup></p>

<p>But Solomon, who must needs have
all that was rare and costly to adorn his
temple, cast his eyes upon this precious
tree, and ordered it to be cut down.<sup><a id="note_18"></a>18</sup> It
was duly felled, and squared, and trimmed,
and it measured thirty cubits in length.<sup><a id="note_19"></a>19</sup>
But when the carpenters came to put it
into a place of that length, it was a cubit
too short, and when it was fitted into
a place of twenty-nine cubits, lo! it
measured thirty, and the carpenters marvelled
much, and were greatly astonished,
and so, being useless, it was laid aside.<sup><a id="note_20"></a>20</sup>
Yet the people came to see this wonderful
tree, and amongst them was a maid
named Maximilla, who sat down upon
it, and instantly her clothes were in a
blaze.<sup><a id="note_21"></a>21</sup> Then she began to lift up her
voice, and prophesy, crying, “My God,
and my Lord Jesu Christ.”<sup><a id="note_22"></a>22</sup> Then the
Jews took her, and scourged her to
death.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_cvi" id="Page_cvi">[cvi]</a></span><sup><a id="note_23"></a>23</sup></p>

<p>The Jews, not knowing what to do
with this miraculous tree, laid it across a
brook,<sup><a id="note_24"></a>24</sup> and, when the Queen of Sheba
came to visit Solomon, she recognized
the virtue of the wood; and, refusing to
defile it with her feet, she dismounted,
and adored it, and waded through the
brook.<sup><a id="note_25"></a>25</sup> Then, when she met Solomon,
she reproved him, and told him that on
that tree would the Saviour of the world
suffer death.<sup><a id="note_26"></a>26</sup> And Solomon commanded
the holy wood to be taken up,<sup><a id="note_27"></a>27</sup> and
caused it to be carried into the Temple,
there to be placed over the door, so that
all men might bless, and adore it, and he
coated it over with gold and silver.<sup><a id="note_28"></a>28</sup>
There it remained until Abias stripped it
of its costly coverings,<sup><a id="note_29"></a>29</sup> and the Jews
buried it deep in the earth.<sup><a id="note_30"></a>30</sup></p>

<p>There it remained for many years,
until the Jews wished to make a pool,
where the priests might wash the beasts,
to purify them, previous to sacrificing
them, and, unknowingly, they dug over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_cvii" id="Page_cvii">[cvii]</a></span>
the burial-place of the Holy Cross.<sup><a id="note_31"></a>31</sup> This
imparted such a virtue to the water of
that pool, which was called Bethesda,
that the sick were healed thereat, and an
angel at times descended from heaven,
and stirred the waters, and then whoever
could get first into the waters was straightway
healed of any infirmity he might
have.<sup><a id="note_32"></a>32</sup></p>

<p>We now come to the Crucifixion,
and there was a lack of wood to make
Christ’s cross—when, suddenly, from the
depths of Bethesda, leaped up the tree
of the Cross, and floated gently to land.
One ran to the High Priest,<sup><a id="note_33"></a>33</sup> and told
him of the timely find of suitable wood,
and he at once gave orders for it to be
fashioned into a Cross.<sup><a id="note_34"></a>34</sup> Then comes
the mournful procession to Calvary, with
our Saviour fainting under the weight of
the Cross, and Simon the Cyrenean is
pressed into the service to help Jesus.<sup><a id="note_35"></a>35</sup>

<p>And whilst the crosses were still standing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_cviii" id="Page_cviii">[cviii]</a></span>
the disciples came to them and
prayed, and many were healed of their
infirmities, and many devils were cast
out.<sup><a id="note_37"></a>37</sup> This so angered the Jews that
they took the crosses down, and buried
them,<sup><a id="note_38"></a>38</sup> and there they remained until
their invention by St. Helena, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 326.
On her arrival at Jerusalem,<sup><a id="note_39"></a>39</sup> she convened
a meeting of the principal Jews,
and they denied all knowledge of it, but,
on threat of being burnt, they said that
one of their number, named Judas, knew
where the crosses were buried.<sup><a id="note_40"></a>40</sup> Judas,
however, refused to tell, and, to compel
him to impart his knowledge, St. Helena
had him lowered into a dry well, “and
there tormented hym by hongre and evyl
reste.”<sup><a id="note_41"></a>41</sup> Seven days of this treatment
made him submissive, and at the end of
that time he capitulated. He was then
drawn up,<sup><a id="note_42"></a>42</sup> and prayed to God to direct
him to the right spot.<sup><a id="note_43"></a>43</sup> His prayer was
heard, and after some digging, the crosses
were discovered.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_cix" id="Page_cix">[cix]</a></span><sup><a id="note_44"></a>44</sup></p>

<p>The news was brought to St. Helena,
who visited the spot,<sup><a id="note_45"></a>45</sup> but although there
were certainly three crosses, no one knew
which was the one upon which Jesus
suffered. A test, however, was applied,
which proved to be satisfactory. The
body of a maid was being borne on a
bier for burial, but the funeral procession
was stopped, and the body was touched
by the different crosses. The two first
produced no effect,<sup><a id="note_46"></a>46</sup> but when the third
touched the dead maiden, she was at
once restored to life.<sup><a id="note_47"></a>47</sup> Here, then, was
proof positive; this was the very Cross;
and St. Helena, mindful of her son Constantine,
divided the sacred wood; part
she enclosed in a case of precious metal,
and kept at Jerusalem;<sup><a id="note_48"></a>48</sup> and part she
sent to her son, at Byzantium, who
received it with due reverence,<sup><a id="note_49"></a>49</sup> and
deposited it in the church, with great
ceremony.<sup><a id="note_50"></a>50</sup></p>

King of Persia, who, aware of the sanctity
of the relic, had it placed on the right
hand of his throne. He was so puffed
up with pride, that he ordered himself
to be adored. His people, hitherto, had
worshipped the sun, but now he ordained
that henceforth he was to be considered
the principal Person in the Trinity (the
Father), and that the relic of the Cross
was to be looked upon as the Son, whilst
a golden cock which he had made was
to represent the Holy Ghost.<sup><a id="note_51"></a>51</sup></p>

<p>Then Heraclius made war against
Chosroes, and meeting with a Persian
army under one of the sons of that
monarch, it was agreed that, in order to
prevent a useless effusion of blood, the
two commanders should fight it out
between them, and whoever was vanquished
should submit.<sup><a id="note_52"></a>52</sup> The duel was
fought on a bridge over the Danube, and
Heraclius vanquished and killed the son
of Chosroes.<sup><a id="note_53"></a>53</sup> The Persian army then
made their submission,<sup><a id="note_54"></a>54</sup> and the penance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_cxi" id="Page_cxi">[cxi]</a></span>
imposed upon them by the conqueror
was that they should all be baptized,
which was duly done.</p>

<p>Heraclius then went to Chosroes, and
told him what he had done, offering him
his life if he too would embrace Christianity,<sup><a id="note_55"></a>55</sup>
but the Persian monarch refused,
and Heraclius smote off his head.<sup><a id="note_56"></a>56</sup> He
then crowned a son of Chosroes, and
caused him to be baptized,<sup><a id="note_57"></a>57</sup> himself standing
sponsor, and buried the slain king
with befitting honours.<sup><a id="note_58"></a>58</sup> Then, taking
possession of the holy relic,<sup><a id="note_59"></a>59</sup> he set out
with it for Jerusalem. But, as he was
bearing it in great state, he came to that
gate of the City through which Jesus
went to His passion, worn, buffeted,
scorned, and weary, carrying the heavy
burden of His cross. And suddenly the
gateway became solid masonry, so that he
could not pass through, and an angel
appeared in the heavens, and reproved
him for his ostentatious display in a place
which his Saviour had previously trodden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_cxii" id="Page_cxii">[cxii]</a></span>
in such deep humility.<sup><a id="note_60"></a>60</sup> Heraclius dismounted
from his horse, and, stripping
himself of all the trappings of royalty,
barefoot, and in his shirt,<sup><a id="note_61"></a>61</sup> he meekly
bore the Cross to its appointed place,<sup><a id="note_62"></a>62</sup>
the masonry disappearing as soon as he
had humbled himself.</p>

<p>A piece of the Cross was afterwards
sent to Rome, where it duly arrived
after a very stormy voyage,<sup><a id="note_63"></a>63</sup> and it was

<div class="sidenote"><i>Length of
Adam’s life.</i></div>
<p>
<a name="Footnote_B_2" id="Footnote_B_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_B_2">[B]</a>This apparently long life of Adam is admitted on all
hands, even in the Revised Version of the Bible. The Talmud
says that God promised him one thousand years of life, and it
is recorded that he begat Seth when he was a hundred and
thirty years old. On this the Talmud (<i>Eruvin</i>, fol. 18, col. 2)
has the following comment: “Rav Yirmyah ben Elazer said:
All those years, which Adam spent in alienation from God,
he begat evil spirits, demons, and fairies; for it is said, ‘And
Adam was an hundred and thirty years, and begat a son in
his own likeness, after his image’; consequently, before that
time, he begat after another image.”
</p>
<p>
This term of one hundred and thirty years seems to have
been a period in Adam’s existence, for we again find (<i>Eruvin</i>,
fol. 18 b.): “Adam was a Chasid, or great saint, when he
observed that the decree of death was occasioned by him; he
<i>fasted</i> a hundred and thirty years, and all this time he abstained
from intercourse with his wife.”
</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Talmud
legends
respecting
Adam’s length
of life.</i></div>
<p>
There is a Talmudical tradition that God showed the
future to Adam (Avoth d’Rab. Nathan, chap. 31): “The
Holy One—blessed be He!—shewed unto Adam each generation,
and its preachers, its guardians, its leaders, its prophets, its
heroes, its sinners, and its saints, saying, ‘In such and such a
generation such and such a <i>King</i> shall reign, in such and such
a generation such and such a wife man shall teach.’”
This is amplified in Midrash Yalkut (fol. 12), where it is
said that God showed Adam all future generations of men,
with their leaders, learned and literary men, and there he
observed that David was credited with only three hours
of life, and he said, “Lord and Creator of the world, is this
unalterable?” “Such was my first intention,” was the reply.
“How many years have I to live?” asked Adam. “One
thousand.” Then Adam said, “I will lend him some of my
years.” And a document was drawn up whereby Adam
transferred seventy years of his life to David.
</p>
<p>
S. Baring-Gould, in his legends of <i>Old Testament Characters</i>,
vol i. p. 77, referring to a Mussulman legend, says: “Finally,
when Adam reached his nine hundred and thirtieth year, the
Angel of Death appeared under the form of a goat, and ran
between his legs.
</p>
<p>
“Adam recoiled with horror, and exclaimed, ‘God has
given me one thousand years; wherefore comest thou now?’
</p>
<p>
“‘What!’ exclaimed the Angel of Death, ‘hast thou not
given seventy years of thy life to the prophet David?’
</p>
<p>
“Adam stoutly denied that he had done so. Then the Angel
of Death drew the document of transfer from out of his beard,
and presented it to Adam, who could no longer refuse to go.”</p></div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>v.</i> 1.</div>
<p>
But when the first man our father Adam heard these things,
that Jesus was baptized in Jordan, he called out to his son
Seth, and said,
</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>v.</i> 2.</div>
<p>
Declare to your sons, the patriarchs and prophets, all those
things which thou didst hear from Michael the Archangel,
when I sent thee to the gates of Paradise to entreat God
that he would anoint my head when I was sick.
</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>v.</i> 3</div>
<p>
Then Seth, coming near to the patriarchs and prophets,
said: I, Seth, when I was praying to God at the gates of
Paradise, beheld the angel of the Lord, Michael, appear unto
me, saying, I am sent unto thee from the Lord; I am
appointed to preside over human bodies.
</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>v.</i> 4.</div>
<p>
I tell thee, Seth, do not pray to God in tears, and entreat
him for the oil of the tree of mercy, wherewith to anoint
thy father Adam for his headach;
</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>v.</i> 5.</div>
<p>
Because thou canst not by any means obtain it till the last
day and times, namely, till five thousand and five hundred

<div class="sidenote"><i>v.</i> 6.</div>
<p>
Then will Christ, the most merciful Son of God, come
on earth to raise again the human body of Adam, and at the
same time to raise the bodies of the dead, and when he cometh
he will be baptized in Jordan;
</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>v.</i> 7.</div>
<p>
Then with the oil of his mercy he will anoint all those
that believe on him; and the oil of his mercy will continue

<div class="sidenote"><i>v.</i> 8.</div>

<p>
When all the patriarchs and prophets heard all these things
from Seth, they rejoiced more.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_F_6" id="Footnote_F_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_F_6">[F]</a> Alban Butler, in <i>The Lives of the Fathers, Martyrs,
and other Principal Saints</i>, denies that St. Helena was an
Innholder (<i>Stabularia</i>) in Bithynia, when Constantius married
her, and says: “We are assured by the unanimous tradition
of our English historians that this holy empress was a native
of our island. William of Malmesbury, the principal historian
of the ancient state of our country after Bede, and before him,
the Saxon author of the life of St. Helen, in 970, quoted by
Usher, expressly say that Constantine was a Briton by birth.”
Leland, in his <i>Commentarii de Scriptoribus Britannicis</i>, says
that St. Helena was the only daughter of King Coilus, the
King Cöol who first built walls round Colchester, and the
English Church has generally recognised her British origin.
Her festival is kept on August 18.
</p>
<p>
When her husband, Constantine Chlorus, entered into an
arrangement with Diocletian, by which he had the countries
this side the Alps, namely, Gaul and Britain, he was obliged,
as part of the bargain, to divorce St. Helena, and marry
Theodora, the daughter-in-law of Maximinianus. According
to Eusebius, she was not converted to Christianity at the same
time as her son Constantine, who, when he came to the throne,
paid her the greatest deference, and gave her the title of
Augusta, or empress. After the Council of Nice, in 325, he
wrote to Macarius, Bishop of Jerusalem, concerning the
building of a splendid church upon Mount Calvary, and St.
Helena, although she was then 79 years of age, undertook to
see it carried out.
</p>
<p>
It was then that the reputed Invention of the Cross, together
with the nails, took place, and she soon afterwards died, but
the exact year is uncertain, some authorities giving <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 326,
others 328.</p></div>
